                <h2>1. Threats to Marine Life</h2>
                <div class="content-box">
                    <img src="11.jpg" alt="Pollution" class="one">
                    <h3>Pollution</h3>
                    <p>Pollution, particularly plastic pollution, is a significant threat to marine ecosystems. It harms marine animals, disrupts habitats, and introduces toxic substances into the food chain. Chemicals like oil, heavy metals, and pesticides are also pollutants that negatively impact marine life.</p>
                    <p>Microplastics, tiny plastic particles, are particularly concerning as they are ingested by marine organisms and enter the food web, affecting both marine life and humans.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-box">
                    <h3>Overfishing</h3>
                    <p>Overfishing depletes fish stocks faster than they can replenish, leading to the collapse of fisheries and disruption of marine food webs. This practice affects the balance of marine ecosystems and endangers many species.</p>
                    <p>Bycatch, the unintentional capture of non-target species, further exacerbates the problem, harming dolphins, turtles, and seabirds.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-box">
                    <h3>Climate Change</h3>
                    <p>Climate change affects marine life through rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and sea level rise. These changes impact coral reefs, fish populations, and marine biodiversity.</p>
                    <p>Coral bleaching, a result of increased water temperatures, leads to the death of coral reefs, which are vital to the marine ecosystem. Ocean acidification, caused by the absorption of excess atmospheric CO2, weakens the shells of marine organisms like mollusks and coral.</p>

                <div class="content-box">
                    <img src="22.png" alt="Marine Protected Areas" class="two">
                    <h3>Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)</h3>
                    <p>MPAs are designated areas where human activities are regulated to protect biodiversity and ecosystems. Successful MPAs have seen significant recovery in marine populations and habitats.</p>
                    <p>Examples include the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in Australia and the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument in the United States, both of which have shown improvements in marine biodiversity and resilience.</p>

                <div class="content-box">
                    <h3>Coral Reef Restoration</h3>
                    <p>Projects like coral reef restoration involve growing and transplanting corals to restore damaged reefs. These efforts help in rebuilding habitats and supporting marine life.</p>
                    <p>Organizations like Coral Restoration Foundation and Reef Renewal are actively working to restore coral reefs around the world, showing positive results in reef recovery and increased marine life diversity.</p>

                <h2>3. How Individuals Can Contribute</h2>
                <div class="content-box">
                    <img src="22.jpg" alt="Reduce Plastic Use" class="three">
                    <h3>Reduce Plastic Use</h3>
                    <p>Minimizing the use of single-use plastics reduces pollution in the oceans. Opt for reusable bags, bottles, and containers.</p>
                    <p>Participate in community recycling programs and support policies that aim to reduce plastic production and increase recycling rates.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-box">
                    <h3>Support Sustainable Seafood</h3>
                    <p>Choosing sustainable seafood helps reduce the impact of overfishing. Look for certifications like MSC (Marine Stewardship Council) when buying seafood.</p>
                    <p>Be informed about seafood sources and support restaurants and suppliers that follow sustainable fishing practices.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-box">
                    <h3>Participate in Beach Cleanups</h3>
                    <p>Joining local beach cleanup events helps remove debris from shorelines and prevents it from entering the ocean.</p>
                    <p>Engage with organizations that organize regular cleanups and consider adopting a local beach to ensure continuous efforts in keeping it clean.</p>
