                    <h2><span>01.</span>Coastal Development</h2>
                    <p>Coastal development, driven by urbanization and infrastructure expansion, leads to habitat destruction and alters natural coastal dynamics. Key habitats like mangroves, salt marshes, and coral reefs are devastated, diminishing biodiversity and increasing coastal vulnerability to erosion and flooding. Additionally, runoff from developed coastal areas introduces pollutants into marine environments, compromising water quality and ecosystem health.</p>

                    <h2><span>02.</span>Tourism Effects</h2>
                    <p>Tourism poses a significant threat to marine life, causing physical damage to coral reefs and habitats, disrupting ecosystems through anchoring, snorkeling, and boat traffic, and contaminating coastal waters with marine litter, sewage discharge, and chemical pollutants. Unsustainable fishing practices, driven by tourism demand, further strain marine resources, leading to fish depletion and disrupting food chains. Therefore, sustainable tourism practices and effective management strategies are crucial to mitigate adverse effects on marine biodiversity and ecosystem integrity.</p>

                    <h2><span>03.</span>Polution from Ships</h2>
                    <P>Marine ecosystems are severely impacted by pollution from ships and maritime activities. Oil spills, ballast water exchange, and emissions from ship exhausts cause long-term harm to marine mammals, seabirds, and coastal habitats. These pollutants disrupt native biodiversity and ecosystems. To minimize environmental impacts and protect marine biodiversity, strict regulations, effective enforcement, and technological innovations are needed.</P>

                    <h2><span>04.</span>Conservation and Sustainable Practives</h2>
                    <p>Human activities like coastal development, tourism, and maritime pollution pose a global threat to marine ecosystems, disrupting habitats, degrading water quality, and reducing marine biodiversity. Sustainable management practices, international cooperation, and public awareness are essential for mitigating these impacts and preserving marine environments for future generations. Adopting responsible policies can protect and conserve these valuable ecological, economic, and cultural benefits.</p>
